# Movies-ETL
## Background
### Extract movies data from wikipedia, kaggle, and MovieLens. Transform the data to clean it up. Load it into a SQL database.
## Refactoring
### Created a function to do all the extracting, transforming, and loading in one cell. Pass the files into the function to get it to go to SQL.
